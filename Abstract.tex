\chapter*{Abstract}
We propose that gravity arises not from curvature of spacetime but from curvature of a scalar time field~$\tau(x)$. 
Starting with a diffeomorphism‑invariant action containing a kinetic term, a light mass $m_\tau\approx10^{-28}\,\si{eV}$, 
and a weak quartic self‑interaction~$\lambda$, variation yields the field equation
\begin{equation}
  \Box\tau=\kappa T,\qquad \kappa=\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}.
\end{equation}
The theory reproduces the four classical Solar‑System tests, delivers post‑Newtonian parameters 
$\gamma=\beta=1$ with vanishing preferred‑frame coefficients, and matches super‑nova distance moduli to 
\SI{0.04}{mag} without dark energy. A Yukawa‑suppressed self‑interaction lets~$\tau$ explain the Bullet‑Cluster 
mass–gas offset while remaining invisible in the Solar System. Quantum‑mechanically, replacing $t\to\tau$ predicts
 altitude‑dependent tunnelling delays at the $10^{-15}$ level. All simulation code is open source; the framework is 
 therefore falsifiable by forthcoming clock‑network, weak‑lensing, and gravitational‑wave observations.
